## This is a page dedicated to share my implementation of some algorithms 

### Coursera Algorithms I

Code I wrote to solve the quizzes when taking the course [Algorithms I at 
Coursera](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1). 

Some code load input tests from text files. Please, *be advised* to change the location to resamble your configuration. 
The path in those files always point to `/home/ubuntu/coursera`

Find the code inside the **src** folder:

- Percolation:
  - (PercolationClient.java)



In the folder **others** you can find other trick algorithms with discussion and explanation.
